If you file a Chapter 7, or your Chapter 11 or Chapter 13 get turned into a 7, then you will be required to turn over non-exempt assets to the trustee. Non-exempt assets are assets that, under the New York State and/or Federal Bankruptcy exemptions are not protected assets. In addition, some assets, like your home, have a limit to what is exempt. Under New York Law, a home’s equity up to $175,000, (lower in most upstate counties), is protected. That means that if there is less equity than $175,000 (the difference between the fair market value less any mortgages, liens and judgements, if any), you may keep the home. This is called the homestead exemption and only applies to your principal residence. You cannot
 carryover the equity to a second home. It also does not prevent the mortgage lender from foreclosing, after dismissal of the case or filing for a relief from a stay.`,

One of the biggest advantages of filing for bankruptcy is the Bankruptcy Stay. By filing for bankruptcy protection, you get an immediate stay from further actions of your creditors. That means the lender cannot sell the house at auction and any asset seized may be returned to you. It stops evections, even if there is a judgement and warrant issued. The stay applies to any Chapter, but cannot be abused. It preserves the status quo until the Bankruptcy Trustee, or the Court can review the situation and determine whether you have a right to the asset, or you can negotiate a settlement with the creditor.`,
