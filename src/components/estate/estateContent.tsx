If you leave a retirement account to anyone other than a spouse, that account must be closed within 10 years and taxes paid on the proceeds when withdrawn. No longer can you stretch the distributions over the life of some distant young beneficiary to avoid paying taxes. Under the new law, the beneficiary does not have to withdraw required minimum payments during that 10 year period, but come the end of those 10 years, the beneficiary can face a large loss of value due to the taxes and the tax bracket they are in. Now is the time to establish a plan to take advantage of different tax brackets and asset protection of a retirement account.`,
